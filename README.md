### Project description
AMUN MR is a project that helps patients to store their medical records in their mobile with this application, and help doctors to show their patients records history to know their patients history, also help the facility to control all people interact with each facility ( Clerks , Doctors , Patients , Admin). So we made two mobile applications one for doctors and one for patients with different functionality, also one website for the facility. Here we use the website that help the admin of the medical facility to control the patients, clerks and doctors to add or delete or show them. Also help the clerk to show the patients and doctors connected to this facility, so the clerk can help the patients by adding their medical record.
